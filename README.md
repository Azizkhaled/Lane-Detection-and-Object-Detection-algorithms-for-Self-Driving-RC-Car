# Lane-Detection-and-Object-Detection-algorithms-for-Self-Driving-RC-Car
<!--With the increase in numbers of car traffic collisions caused by the human  driver, many car companies are now moving towards developing intelligent vision systems to help the car navigate itself safely. These systems are mainly  concerned about two things, detecting objects around the car and keeping the car  between the lanes. For detecting objects, most systems include sensor subsystems that surround the car, such as lidar, sonar, IMU, and odometry which  can be costly and not efficient since these sensors alone cannot fully identify the  objects and extract information from surroundings, such as colors in a traffic  light, reading signs…etc. In this work, we addressed these issues by developing algorithms for detecting objects that surround the car using machine learning and  Haar feature-based cascade classifier. Also, this work includes algorithms for  lane detection using Hough line transform and Canny edge detection and  improves these algorithms by using histogram method for identifying the lanes. Moreover, these algorithms are optimized to work on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as the master device which will be responsible for sending information to the Arduino  UNO which will be responsible for controlling the motors of the RC car.

## About the Project
With a surge in traffic accidents due to human error, the automobile industry is steering towards an ingenious solution: smart vision systems that let vehicles navigate on their own. We've hopped on this tech-driven journey to ensure cars cruise safely and efficiently.

Our focus? Two crucial aspects: pinpointing objects around the car and guiding it neatly between the lanes. While many systems lean on sensors like lidar, sonar, IMUs, and odometry, we've come to realize that these alone can't capture the complete picture. Imagine a sensor trying to identify the color of a traffic light or decode road signs – it's like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces.

In our work, we've cracked the code by crafting algorithms that use machine learning and Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect objects encircling the vehicle. For lane detection, we are utilizing the Hough line transform and Canny edge detection, we're finding the lanes and amping up the game with histogram magic to enhance accuracy.

All these high-octane algorithms are tailor-fit and optimized to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. This tech powerhouse orchestrates the show, sending key data to the Arduino UNO, the motor maestro controlling the RC car's every move.
