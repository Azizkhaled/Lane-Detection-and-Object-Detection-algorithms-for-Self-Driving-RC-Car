# Lane-Detection-and-Object-Detection-algorithms-for-Self-Driving-RC-Car
With the increase in numbers of car traffic collisions caused by the human  driver, many car companies are now moving towards developing intelligent vision systems to help the car navigate itself safely. These systems are mainly  concerned about two things, detecting objects around the car and keeping the car  between the lanes. For detecting objects, most systems include sensor subsystems that surround the car, such as lidar, sonar, IMU, and odometry which  can be costly and not efficient since these sensors alone cannot fully identify the  objects and extract information from surroundings, such as colors in a traffic  light, reading signsâ€¦etc. In this work, we addressed these issues by developing algorithms for detecting objects that surround the car using machine learning and  Haar feature-based cascade classifier. Also, this work includes algorithms for  lane detection using Hough line transform and Canny edge detection and  improves these algorithms by using histogram method for identifying the lanes. Moreover, these algorithms are optimized to work on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as the master device which will be responsible for sending information to the Arduino  UNO which will be responsible for controlling the motors of the RC car.
